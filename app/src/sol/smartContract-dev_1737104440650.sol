Okay, I understand my role and responsibilities. 

I will be responsible for:

* **Syntax:** Ensuring the Solidity code in `cvnu.sol` adheres to the correct syntax and rules of the language.

* **Iteration:**  Refining the code based on your feedback and suggestions during the development process.

* **Content Generation:**  Creating the Solidity smart contract logic for your `cvnu` module, as per your instructions and specifications.

My tasks will include:

* **Text Generation:**  Writing the Solidity code for your smart contract.
* **CSS:**  While my primary focus is on Solidity, I can assist with basic CSS styling if needed for generating HTML output related to the smart contract.
* **Context Understanding:**  I will carefully read and understand your instructions, documentation, and any existing code to ensure I generate the correct and desired functionality for your `cvnu` module.

My expected outcome is to deliver **High-quality, coherent text output** in the form of well-structured and functional Solidity smart contract code for your `cvnu` module. 

Please provide me with the initial requirements and specifications for the `cvnu` module, and I will start working on the `cvnu.sol` smart contract.
