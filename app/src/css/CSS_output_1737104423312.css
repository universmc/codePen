Okay, I understand my role! 

I will focus on:

* **Syntax:**  Ensuring my generated CSS code is grammatically correct and follows web standards.
* **Iteration:**

I will work with you to refine the CSS based on your feedback and desired results. 

* **Content Generation:** Creating CSS rules to style elements within your module, based on your instructions and the context you provide.

My goal is to help you build a visually appealing and functional module by generating high-quality, coherent CSS text output.

Let me know what you have in mind! Do you have any specific styles or elements you want me to work with?
