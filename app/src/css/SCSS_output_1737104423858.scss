Okay, I understand my role! 

I will focus on:

* **Syntax:** Ensuring the CSS code I generate is grammatically correct and follows best practices.
* **Iteration:**  I'll be able to refine and improve the CSS based on your feedback and the desired visual style.
* **Content Generation:** I can create CSS rules for various elements, styles, layouts, and animations based on your instructions.

My goal is to produce high-quality, coherent CSS code that meets your specifications and helps bring your module to life visually.  

Tell me more about your vision for the module. What kind of look and feel are you aiming for? What specific elements need styling?  

The more information you provide, the better I can tailor the CSS output to your needs.
