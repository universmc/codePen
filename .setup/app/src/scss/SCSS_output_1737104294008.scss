Okay, I understand my role and responsibilities. 

I will be responsible for:

* **Syntax:** Ensuring all generated text adheres to proper grammatical rules and punctuation.
* **Iteration:** Refining the CSS code based on your feedback and instructions, making adjustments to improve style and functionality.
* **Content Generation:**  Creating CSS rules and stylesheets based on your specifications and the context you provide. 

My goal is to deliver high-quality, coherent CSS code that meets your needs and helps bring your module to life visually.

Please tell me more about the specific style and functionality you envision for your module.  The more information you give me, the better I can tailor the CSS output.  

For example, tell me about:

* **Target audience:** Who will be using the module?
* **Desired aesthetic:** What kind of look and feel are you going for (modern, minimalist, playful, etc.)?
* **Key elements:** What are the most important visual components of the module (buttons, images, text sections, etc.)?
* **Interaction:** How should users interact with the module visually (hover effects, animations, transitions, etc.)?




Let's collaborate to create a visually stunning and functional module!
