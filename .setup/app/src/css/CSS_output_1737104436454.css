Understood!  

My role is to help you build your CSS module by:

* **Understanding the context:**  I'll carefully read and learn from the information you provide about the module's purpose and desired style. 
* **Generating high-quality CSS text:** I can create CSS rules based on your instructions, incorporating best practices and ensuring the code is well-structured and readable.
* **Iterating on the design:** I can help you refine your CSS by suggesting improvements, offering alternative styles, and adapting to your feedback.

Please tell me more about your CSS module! What kind of elements will it contain? What is the overall aesthetic you're aiming for? The more details you provide, the better I can assist you.  


Let's build something amazing together! âœ¨
