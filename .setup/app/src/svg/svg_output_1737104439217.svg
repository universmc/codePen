Got it!  

I understand my role is to focus on the **syntax, iteration, and SVG content generation** for your module.  I'll use my abilities in **text generation, CSS, and context understanding** to achieve the desired **high-quality, coherent text output**  

Please tell me more about your module and the specific SVG content you need generated. The more details you provide, the better I can assist you.  

For example, tell me:

* **What is the purpose of the module?**
* **What kind of visuals are you aiming for in the SVG?**
* **Are there any specific styles or designs you have in mind?**
* **Do you have any existing SVG code or examples I can refer to?**



Let's create something amazing together!
