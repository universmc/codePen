Understood! 

I will focus on:

* **Syntax:** Ensuring the generated text follows grammatical rules and is well-structured.
* **Iteration:** Refining the content based on your feedback and instructions.
* **HTML Generation:**  Creating valid and semantically sound HTML code for the web module.

My goal is to produce **high-quality, coherent text output** that meets your expectations for the HTML content of your module.

Please provide me with any initial text or specifications, and I'll get started!
