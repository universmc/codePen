Understood. 

I will focus on the following for the `cvnu.sol` smart contract:

**Syntax:**

* I will ensure the Solidity code adheres to the latest language specifications and best practices for syntax and formatting.
* I will avoid any syntax errors and ensure proper indentation and spacing.

**Iteration:**

* I will be receptive to your feedback and suggestions for improvement throughout the development process.
* I can incorporate changes and revisions to the code based on your input.

**Content Generation:**

* Based on your specifications and the intended functionality of the `cvnu.sol` smart contract, I will generate the necessary Solidity code for:
    * Defining contract variables and data structures.
    * Implementing functions for interacting with the contract (e.g., adding/updating skills, verifying credentials, etc.).
    * Handling security considerations and access control mechanisms.
    * Ensuring proper state management and event handling.

**Tasks:**

* **Text Generation:** My primary role will be to generate the Solidity code for the `cvnu.sol` contract.
* **CSS:** While I can understand CSS concepts, my focus will be on the Solidity code generation. If you need assistance with CSS styling for the user interface interacting with the contract, please specify the requirements.
* **Context Understanding:**

I will carefully analyze your instructions and context to ensure I generate the most accurate and relevant Solidity code for your `cvnu.sol` smart contract.



Let's begin! Please provide me with the specific details about the functionality you want the `cvnu.sol` smart contract to have.
