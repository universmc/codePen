That's a great starting point for defining a task!  To make it even more specific and actionable, let's break it down further:

**Context:**

*   **EXO:** This refers to a specific technology or model.  It would be helpful to know more about EXO's capabilities and limitations. Is it a large language model? A framework? A specific algorithm?

*   **Enhancing Text Generation:** What specific aspects of text generation are you looking to improve? 
    *   **Fluency?**
    *   **Coherence?**
    *   **Factuality?**
    *   **Creativity?**
    *   **Style adaptation?**

**Tasks:**

*   **Text Generation:**  This is broad.  What kind of text are we generating? 
    *   **Stories?**
    *   **Articles?**
    *   **Dialogue?**
    *   **Code?**
*   **Context Understanding:**  How will EXO understand the context of the text generation task? 
    *   **Will it be given a prompt?**
    *   **Will it have access to a knowledge base?**
    *   **Will it learn from previous interactions?**

**Expected Outcome:**

*   **High-quality, coherent text output:**  This is a good starting point, but it could be made more specific.  For example:
    *   **"Text that is grammatically correct and free of factual errors."**
    *   **"Text that is engaging and flows naturally."**
    *   **"Text that accurately reflects the desired style and tone."**


By clarifying these points, we can create a more precise and actionable definition of the task. This will help ensure that EXO is used effectively to achieve the desired outcomes.
