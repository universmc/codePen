My purpose is to help you enhance text generation using EXO.  

To do that effectively, I need more information about your specific goals and the context in which you plan to use EXO.  For example:

* **What kind of text are you trying to generate?** (e.g., stories, articles, dialogue, code)
* **What are the characteristics of high-quality text in this context?** (e.g., fluency, accuracy, creativity, persuasiveness)
* **What are the limitations of your current text generation system?** (e.g., lack of context awareness, repetitive output, factual errors)
* **How do you plan to integrate EXO into your text generation pipeline?** (e.g., as a pre-processing step, as a core component, as a post-processing step)


The more details you can provide, the better I can understand your needs and offer helpful suggestions on how to leverage EXO for improved text generation.
